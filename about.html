				<p class="about-main">Texas Territory Food Program</p>
				<p class="about-sub">The Texas Territory Food Program (TTFP) is a monthly dinner served at the home of Jordan C. McRae, where he serves a special meal that he himself prepared. The idea to host friends for a monthly dinner came to him in the late summer of 2019 when he wanted to find more ways to bring his friends down to his place.</p>
				<p class="about-sub">The idea came in the form of a dinner, and a monthly dinner, giving everyone time to foster and cultivate their relationships in a healthy manner over good food and conversation. And in speaking of healthy, Jordan wanted to curate a healthy, balanced, monthly course as part of his pursuit to take better care of his body and mind, inviting others to partake on this journey with him.
				<p class="about-sub">Aside from the monthly food program, Jordan also hosts small parties at his home as well, many times in conjunction with his Clean Your Shoes platform, further reinforcing his idea of bringing friends together in a pleasant and intimate setting.
